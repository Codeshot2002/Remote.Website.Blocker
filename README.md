# Remote.Website.Blocker
This is an android app where you can add websites to block it in the client windows computer.

How it Works:-
-> It sends the data in string format to a realtime database formed on google firebase.
-> Further the windows client requests the database for the data.
-> Then it blocks those websites through a website blocking mechanism in python.
